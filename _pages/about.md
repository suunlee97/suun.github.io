I am Su-un Lee (이수운, pronounced as "Soo-Woon").

I am a fourth-year PhD student at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) advised by [Prof. Liang Jiang](https://liangjiang.uchicago.edu/). I received my B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) in 2022.

I theoretically study quantum information and quantum computing. My research seeks to identify both the opportunities and fundamental limitations of near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computation, spanning:
- Near-term quantum advantage
- Classical simulation of noisy quantum circuits
- Learning/benchmarking quantum processes
- Quantum error correction
